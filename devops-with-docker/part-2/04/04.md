# Exercise 2.4

In this exercise you should expand the configuration done in Exercise 2.3 and set up the example backend to use the key-value database Redis.

Redis is quite often used as a cache to store data so that future requests for data can be served faster.

The backend uses a slow API to fetch some information. You can test the slow API by requesting /ping?redis=true with curl. The frontend app has a button to test this.

So you should improve the performance of the app and configure a Redis container to cache information for the backend. The documentation of the Redis image might contain some useful info.

The backend README should have all the information that is needed for configuring the backend.

When you've correctly configured the button will turn green.

Submit the docker-compose.yml

The restart: unless-stopped configuration can help if the Redis takes a while to get ready.
