# Exercise 2.9

Most of the buttons may have stopped working in the example application. Make sure that every button for exercises works.

Remember to take a peek into the browser's developer consoles again like we did back part 1, remember also this and this.

The buttons of the Nginx exercise and the first button behave differently but you want them to match.

If you had to make any changes explain what you did and where.

Submit the docker-compose.yml and both Dockerfiles.

## Answer

### Dockerfile

Add a build argument for the backend URL, with a default value for previous exercises to still work

```Dockerfile
COPY . .
ARG REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080 # Default for exercises before 2.8
ENV REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=${REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL}
RUN npm run build
```

### compose.yaml

Add a build arg to pass in the correct backend URL

```yaml
web:
  build:
    context: ../../example-frontend
    args:
      - REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost/api
```
