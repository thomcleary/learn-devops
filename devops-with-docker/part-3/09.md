# Exercise 3.9: Multi-staged Backend

Let us do a multi-stage build for the backend project since we've come so far with the application.

The project is in Golang and building a binary that runs in a container, while straightforward, isn't exactly trivial. Use resources that you have available (Google, example projects) to build the binary and run it inside a container that uses FROM scratch.

To successfully complete the exercise the image must be smaller than 25MB.

## Answer

- Statically linked the `server` binary
- Removed symbols from `server` with `strip`
- Only copied `server` binary file into scratch

```shell
$ docker images
