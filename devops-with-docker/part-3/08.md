# Exercise 3.8: Multi-stage Frontend

Do now a multi-stage build for the example frontend.

Even though multi-stage builds are designed mostly for binaries in mind, we can leverage the benefits with our frontend project as having original source code with the final assets makes little sense. Build it with the instructions in README and the built assets should be in build folder.

You can still use the serve to serve the static files or try out something else.

## Answer

Only copying over build files results in a roughly ~500mb size reduction

```shell
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
10-web       latest    c8a116026626   19 seconds ago   202MB
```
