# Exercise 3.7

As you may have guessed, you shall now return to the frontend and backend from the previous exercise.

Change the base image in FROM to something more suitable. To avoid the extra hassle, it is a good idea to use a pre-installed image for both Node.js and Golang. Both should have at least Alpine variants ready in DockerHub.

Note that the frontend requires Node.js version 16 to work, so you must search for a bit older image.

Make sure the application still works after the changes.

Document the size before and after your changes.

## Answer

Switching to `alpine` variants of base images reduced image sizes too less than half their original size

```shell
$ docker compose up --build
...

$ docker images
REPOSITORY                                TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED             SIZE
10-web                                    latest    a4f7333061d2   5 minutes ago       718MB
10-backend                                latest    d83c154e3523   9 minutes ago       651MB

```
